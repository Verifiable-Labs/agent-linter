# AL001 Duplicate action names

## What it checks
Every action definition must have a unique name.

## Why it matters
Duplicate action names make invocations ambiguous and can route execution to the wrong adapter.

## Failing example
Two definitions share the same name.

## Remediation
Rename or remove duplicates so every action name is unique.
