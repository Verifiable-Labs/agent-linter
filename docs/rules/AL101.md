# AL101 Invocation references unknown action

## What it checks
Every action invocation must reference an action that is explicitly defined.

## Why it matters
Invocations that reference undefined actions indicate broken wiring, stale code, or unsafe dynamic behavior.

In production systems this often results in runtime failures or unintended execution paths.

## Failing example
An invocation specifies an action name that does not exist in the action definitions.

## Remediation
Define the referenced action or correct the invocation to use a valid action name.
