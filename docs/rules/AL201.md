# AL201 Production wiring must not be default

## What it checks
Execution wiring must not bind actions to production environments by default.

## Why it matters
Default production wiring dramatically increases the risk of accidental destructive actions during development, testing, or review.

Safe systems require explicit intent before interacting with production resources.

## Failing example
An action is wired to a production or production-like environment without explicit gating.

## Remediation
Remove production bindings from default wiring and require explicit environment selection or approval.
