# AL003 Overly permissive parameter types

## What it checks
Action parameters must not use overly permissive types such as `any` or unbounded `object`.

## Why it matters
Permissive parameter types hide the true execution surface of an agent and make it impossible to reason about safety, impact, or correctness.

They also prevent meaningful static analysis and review.

## Failing example
An action parameter is defined with type `any` or a generic `object` without explicit structure.

## Remediation
Use explicit primitive types or define structured object properties with clear constraints.
