# AL102 Missing required invocation parameters

## What it checks
Action invocations must include all parameters marked as required in the action definition.

## Why it matters
Missing required parameters can lead to partial execution, unsafe defaults, or unpredictable side effects.

Static detection of these issues prevents costly runtime failures.

## Failing example
An invocation omits one or more required parameters defined by the action.

## Remediation
Add all required parameters to the invocation arguments.
